# Pinterest-Website-Clone
EDUNET AICTE FRONT END DEVELOPMENT INTERNSHIP PROJECT

Creating a Pinterest website clone involved several strategic enhancements to create a unique and engaging user experience. The project began with visual design customization, implementing a distinctive layout with a minimalist design, a custom color palette, and unique fonts, which provided a cohesive and visually appealing aesthetic aligned with the brand identity. Advanced features were then added, such as enhanced search filters, custom image tags. This was writen in basic HTML, CSS JavaScript programming languages.

Unique user profile pages and a personalized onboarding process were designed to make the application more welcoming and user-centric, thus improving overall user satisfaction. The user can login using username and password, currently there is no fixed username and password any name and password can be given for this.

These can be further developed for customizations resulting in a highly personalized, efficient, and visually distinct application, successfully transforming the Pinterest clone into a unique platform that stands out in functionality and aesthetics.

The folder "pts" contains all the required codes and images that were used in developing this web page.
